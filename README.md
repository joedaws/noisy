# Noisy

An elixir library for generating **interesting** (according to the author at least) groups of 
nodes on a sphere.

## Notes 

Here's a write up about 2-dimensional guassians and how to compute them.

What's more organize than tha 2-dimensional Guassian.

- [ ] Figure out a formula for a distribution that follows a curve. 
      That is given a curve as input, generate a probability density for every 
      slice that is orthogonal to the curve.

## Ideas

* Use population density data to define a random variable whose probability density
  is higher whenever the population density is higher. So basically re-normalize 
  a population density into a probability density.

* Each of the cultures has it's own plane of existence on which the starting nodes
  for beings of that culture are. There are of course ways to travel between planes.
  
* On the other hand for the "dream-realm" beings, we have to come up with
  the "inverted continents" and one way would be to draw soemthing based on
  middle earth geography. For example, see 
  [Middle Earth SVG](https://github.com/JacobThwaites/Middle-Earth-SVG/blob/master/index.html)
  
* It makes sense to have the dream-realm and weird science planes be 
somewhat interesting spheres. There's realms are most closely aligned. 
The deep denizens realm is much more spread out and interests 
less often with the other two realms.
